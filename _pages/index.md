I am a Research Software Engineer in the AI Engineering department at the [IBM Research, India](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/), situated in the Bangalore office. Previously, I pursued my MS by Research in Computer Science from the [Centre for Visual Information Technology](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at the [IIIT, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), under the guidance and supervision of [Dr. Anoop Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/). <br><br>

My interests lie in applications of deep neural networks to computer vision and natural language processing. Presently, I am working on interpretability of NLP models, while previously, my thesis was on multi-task models for vision. In my free time, I try to contribute to open source libraries. By night, I am also a comic book afficianado and science fiction geek. <br> <br>
