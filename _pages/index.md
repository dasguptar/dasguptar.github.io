I am currently a Data & Applied Scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). (For the more curious, I work on [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) as part of the WebXT division at Search Technology Center India.) <br> <br>
Prior to this, I worked as a Research Software Engineer in the AI Engineering department at [IBM Research, India](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/). <br>
Even earlier, I pursued my MS by Research in Computer Science from  [IIIT, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), under the guidance of [Dr. Anoop Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/).<br><br>
My interests lie in applying machine learning, with a focus on deep neural networks, to novel & complex problems, mostly in the domains of vision & language. <br>
I am passionate about bridging the gap between research & deployment, to bring innovative machine learning powered solutions to customers faster.<br>
Much of my recent experience is in optimizing deep networks for real-world production constraints, including but not limited to large-scale data, high throughput, & low latency. <br> <br>
By night, I am also a comic book afficianado & science fiction geek. <br>
